# Introduction

**Malware mutation** refers to the automated generation of new malware variants that evade detection mechanisms. This includes:

* **Polymorphic malware**: Alters its code on each execution.
* **Metamorphic malware**: Rewrites its own code entirely while retaining the same functionality.

These notes won't cover AI/LLM-generated malware - I'll have these on a separate section.

## Polymorphic Malware
**Polymorphic malware** is a type of malicious software that can change its code structure, appearance, or signature while maintaining its core functionality. The term "polymorphic" comes from the Greek words meaning "many forms."

The key characteristic of polymorphic malware is its ability to mutate or transform itself each time it replicates or spreads to a new system. This transformation typically involves:
* **Code obfuscation**: Changing variable names, rearranging code blocks, or inserting dummy instructions
* **Encryption with variable keys**: Using different encryption keys each time to encrypt the malware payload
* **Code rewriting**: Generating functionally equivalent but structurally different code

The primary purpose of these transformations is to evade detection by traditional signature-based antivirus systems, which rely on identifying known patterns or "signatures" in malware code. Since polymorphic malware constantly changes its signature, it can slip past these detection methods while still performing the same malicious activities.
This makes polymorphic malware particularly challenging for cybersecurity professionals to detect and defend against, as it requires more sophisticated detection methods that focus on behavior analysis rather than just signature matching.


## Metamorphic Malware
Unlike polymorphic malware, **metamorphic malware** completely rewrites its own code with each infection, creating entirely new versions of itself rather than just changing its appearance through encryption or obfuscation.


# Sectors at risk
Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) is particularly vulnerable due to:
* Legacy systems
* Low patch cadence
* Flat networks

High-risk sectors:


| **Sector**	| **Risk** |
|:---|:---------------|
| Energy	| SCADA/ICS often run on legacy OS; malware mutation evades older EDRs |
| Water & Waste |	Fragmented OT infrastructure with weak segmentation |
| Transport	| Network convergence of IT/OT creates larger attack surfaces |
| Healthcare | Legacy medical devices, lack of unified cybersecurity governance |
| Telecom	| Targeted for both surveillance and disruption, especially in hybrid warfare contexts |
